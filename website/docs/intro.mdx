## Introduction

FlatifyCSS is the web modern and minimalist flat design library for clever and stylish developers, inspired by [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) design system. It respects accessibility and good practices are provided to acknowledge that "the web is for everyone".

When we talk about flat design, you might think about the creepy palette and some old-fashioned web trends, but no, flat design is a wide term and in this case for FlatifyCSS, there are some principles that shape it clearly you will understand it easily.
